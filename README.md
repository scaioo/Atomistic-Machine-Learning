# Atomistic Machine Learning

## Overview

This project explores machine learning methods applied to atomistic simulations and materials science. The goal is to develop and benchmark models that predict properties and behaviors of materials at the atomic scale, leveraging datasets from molecular dynamics, quantum mechanics, and crystallography.
